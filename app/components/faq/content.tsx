				ZWS uses zero width characters instead of the typical alphanumeric ones that URL shorteners use. When rendered,
				these characters appear invisible, but they're still there, which means that ZWS is able to use them to encode
				information about your URL.

					We try to only use characters which don't render as anything, but some devices might render them as boxes. If

			<p>
				Because zero width characters aren't commonly used, some chat services or social media platforms will strip them
				out. Which, unfortunately, prevents you from being able to share zws.im URLs on those platforms.
